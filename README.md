# Hi, I'm Fadel Najmi Adliansyah 👋

I build applications that solve real-world problems.

I believe good software is not just about making things work — it's about making them clear, maintainable, and collaborative.

I care deeply about code clarity so that anyone who collaborates with me can understand, contribute, and scale the project comfortably.
